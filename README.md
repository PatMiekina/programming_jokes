cypress/videos
```

2. Install start server as a dependency
`npm install --save-dev start-server-and-test`
3. Add missing scripts to package.json
```json
"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node .",
    "dev": "nodemon . & npm run scss",
    "scss": "sass --watch src/scss/main.scss public/styles/main.css",
    "cypress:open": "cypress open",
    "cypress:run": "cypress run",
    "server": "node src/index.js",
    "ci": "start-server-and-test server http://localhost:3000 cypress:run"
  },
  ```

10. Paste this into configuration file to replace existing code:

```
# This config is equivalent to both the '.circleci/extended/orb-free.yml' and the base '.circleci/config.yml'
version: 2.1

# Orbs are reusable packages of CircleCI configuration that you may share across projects, enabling you to create encapsulated, parameterized commands, jobs, and executors that can be used across multiple projects.
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-intro/
orbs:
  node: circleci/node@4.7
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@2.1.0

# Invoke jobs via workflows
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#workflows
workflows:
  sample: # This is the name of the workflow, feel free to change it to better match your workflow.
    # Inside the workflow, you define the jobs you want to run.
    jobs:
      - cypress/run:
         start: npm server
         wait-on: 'http://localhost:3000'
```

11. Select 'Save and run' and 

![fast config](public/assets/images/config-file2.png)
