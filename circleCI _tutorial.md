# CircleCI Setup Tutorial

This is a step by step tutorial to add CircleCI to your project. It is a continuation of [government front-end styling tutorial](https://github.com/PatMiekina/gov-styling) and [cypress tutorial](https://github.com/PatMiekina/cypress-tutorial)

Big shoutout to marvelous [Donny](https://github.com/donnyhyon) & fabulous [Gabby](https://github.com/gab-bernotaite) for working on a tutorial with me, thanks guys! ❤️

1. Create a .gitignore file (`touch .gitignore`) (if not already there). Add following to file:
```
node_modules
cypress/screenshots
cypress/videos
```

2. Install start server as a dependency
`npm install --save-dev start-server-and-test`
3. Add missing scripts to package.json
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT PATH FOR “server” script!
```json
"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node .",
    "dev": "nodemon . & npm run scss",
    "scss": "sass --watch src/scss/main.scss public/styles/main.css",
    "cypress:open": "cypress open",
    "cypress:run": "cypress run",
    "server": "node src/index.js",
    "ci": "start-server-and-test server http://localhost:3000 cypress:run"
  },
  ```

4. Make sure your repository is pushed to github
5. Go to [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) & log in
6. Select 'Add project' 
-> select the repository with the project from your github 
-> select Fast: Take me to config.yml template that I can edit
![fast config](public/assets/images/fast-config-setup.png)
-> from the list select Node

![fast config](public/assets/images/sample-configs2.png)

7. Go to ‘organisation settings’ in left panel → security → in orb security settings select ‘yes’

![fast config](public/assets/images/org-settings2.png)

8. Select 'Commit & Run' (we will be changing the config.yml) in the next steps
9. Go to main page, press on three dots of project and go to configuration file
![fast config](public/assets/images/config-file.png)

10. Paste this into configuration file to replace existing code:

```
# This config is equivalent to both the '.circleci/extended/orb-free.yml' and the base '.circleci/config.yml'
version: 2.1

# Orbs are reusable packages of CircleCI configuration that you may share across projects, enabling you to create encapsulated, parameterized commands, jobs, and executors that can be used across multiple projects.
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-intro/
orbs:
  node: circleci/node@4.7
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@2.1.0

# Invoke jobs via workflows
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#workflows
workflows:
  sample: # This is the name of the workflow, feel free to change it to better match your workflow.
    # Inside the workflow, you define the jobs you want to run.
    jobs:
      - cypress/run:
         start: npm server
         wait-on: 'http://localhost:3000'
```

11. Select 'Save and run' and 

![fast config](public/assets/images/config-file2.png)

commit to existing branch

![fast config](public/assets/images/commit.png)

11. Merge CircleCI pull request branch with main branch on github

![fast config](public/assets/images/pull-request.png)

12. Pull from github

```
git pull
```

13. ENJOY ALL GREEN! :D 

14. Figure out what `npm run ci` does -> does it run the tests on CircleCI from the console?
